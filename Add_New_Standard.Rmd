So you want to add a new standard to the Ingalls Standards Sheet!


What is the compound name?
What is the exact mass?
What is the retention time?
What is the HILIC mode (if applicable)?
What is the HILIC mix?
What is the z?
What is the empirical formula (this can be automated)?
What is the ionization form?
What is the liquid fraction?
What is the concentration in uM?
Add KEGG ID and names:
Add ChEBI:
Add InCHI:
Add SMILES:
Add Classyfire:
Is it a priority?
What is today's date?

```{r Test Standards, include=TRUE}

Test <- read.csv("Ingalls_Lab_Standards.csv") %>%
  slice(1:10)

```

## Doing this with one specific compound
# compound.name <- "L-Methionine"
# 
# path <- paste("https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rest/pug/compound/name/", compound.name, 
#               "/property/Title,MolecularFormula,inchikey,CanonicalSMILES,IUPACName/CSV", sep = "")
# 
# r <- GET(url = path) 
# status_code(r)
# content(r)
# mydata <- read.csv(text = gsub("\t\n", "", r), sep = ",",
#                    header = TRUE)
