## Ingalls Standards Repository

This repository contains all the relevant information for most updated list of the Ingalls Lab Standards. This includes the original standards list (titled "Ingalls_Lab_Standards.csv") in the data_raw/ directory, and the new standards list (titled "Ingalls_Lab_Standards_NEW.csv").

If you are looking to simply use the new Ingalls Standards list, download Ingalls_Lab_Standards_NEW.csv and use accordingly. If you would like to view a previous version of the standards, or see how changes were made, the **Control.Rmd** markdown file manages the log history of changes to the original csv.
