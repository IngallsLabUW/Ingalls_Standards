## Ingalls Standards Repository

This repository contains all the relevant information for most updated
list of the Ingalls Lab Standards. This includes the original standards
list (titled “Ingalls\_Lab\_Standards.csv”) in the data\_raw/ directory,
and the new standards list (titled “Ingalls\_Lab\_Standards\_NEW.csv”).

If you are looking to simply use the new Ingalls Standards list,
download Ingalls\_Lab\_Standards\_NEW.csv and use accordingly. If you
would like to view a previous version of the standards, or see how
changes were made, the **Control.Rmd** markdown file manages the log
history of changes to the original csv.
